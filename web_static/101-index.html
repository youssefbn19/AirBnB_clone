                        quaint, 400 square ft. with a full bath, mini kitchen, & living room. The extra high ceiling
                        make the home feel more spacious. The sofa converts to a bed also. We have a hand made counter
                        area that adds character to the room and a great porch/deck to relax on and have a glass of
                        Merlot.
